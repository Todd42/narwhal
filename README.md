# Team Narwhal: Argument Parser

### This was a semester long group project developed in Java using Scrum processes.

This was a semester long, group project for Software Engineering. It is implemented in Java and tested with JUnit (unit tests) and robot framework (acceptance tests).

The argument parser takes arguments and flags via the command line and compares them against arguments that were added by the programmer. The arguments can be set to multiple types (string, int, float, boolean) and the flags are boolean values (true when entered, false when left out). The argument parser also has the capability to save arguments to an XML document and load them from existing documents.
