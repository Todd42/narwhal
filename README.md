***** 02/04/15 *****
First day with scrum team. We looked at the product backlog, made Trello accounts, and shared contact information.

***** 02/05/15 *****
We looked through the product backlog, and using the Planning Poker technique we assigned values to items in the product backlog.

***** 02/06/15 *****
We made our first unit test involving our addArg function inside the ArgumentParser.java class

***** 02/09/15 *****
Through group discussion we decided to scrap our initial ArgumentParser class due to problems with initial ideas.

***** 02/10/15 *****
Made a couple unit tests so we could write our next code. We had good ideas to make a good base level

***** 02/11/15 *****
Talked a lot about how to build our object that will hold the values for an argument. We also talked about Git and fixed the machines that we are using to code. We made another unit test for our object.

***** 02/12/15 *****
During scrum we talked and worked out many functionalities that need to be build. Towards the end of our scrum unit tests were made, and a demo VolumeCalculator class was created.

***** 02/13/15 *****
There were a lot of things that got done with our overnight responsibilities. A parse function was completed, the addArgument function was enhanced, and some refactoring of code.
